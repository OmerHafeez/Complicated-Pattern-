# Complicated-Pattern-
Write a C++ recursive function PrintPattern to print following pattern using recursion. No loops
are allowed whatsoever, and you can write other helping recursive functions (max 4function). For
example, calling your function with these arguments PrintPattern (5,1,5) should print the
following pattern. Your function prototype must be as follows:
Prototype: void PrintPattern(int, int ,int);
